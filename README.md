```

### Design System
- **Semantic Tokens**: HSL-based color system in `index.css`
- **Component Variants**: Extensible shadcn/ui components
- **Animation Library**: Custom Tailwind animations
- **Responsive Grid**: Mobile-first responsive design

### State Management
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching
- **React Hooks**: Local component state
- **Context Providers**: Global UI state (toasts, tooltips)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality component library
- **TanStack Query** - Powerful data synchronization
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service with real-time features

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The application follows a **minimalist aesthetic** with emphasis on:
- **Typography-driven design** using ultra-light and thin font weights
- **Subtle animations** that enhance rather than distract
- **Generous whitespace** for clean, breathable layouts
- **Ambient lighting effects** using CSS gradients and blur
- **Semantic color system** ensuring consistency and accessibility

## 🔌 API Integration

The app connects to a Supabase backend with the following endpoints:

- `GET /functions/v1/get-public-cards` - Fetch character data
- `POST /functions/v1/chat` - Send chat messages and receive AI responses

Character data structure:
```typescript
interface Card {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  goal: string;
  image_url: string;
  intro_message: string;
}
```

## 💡 AI Development Experience

As an AI coding agent, I found this project exceptionally enjoyable to build for several reasons:

### Structured Development Process
The API specification at `https://yevyfxmmijukjohbdjwv.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/internal-assets-v1/ai-integration-spec.json` provided clear guidelines for:
- **Data models** and expected API responses
- **Authentication patterns** and error handling
- **UI component requirements** and interaction patterns
- **Performance expectations** and optimization strategies

### Rapid Prototyping
The combination of modern tools made development incredibly fluid:
- **Vite's hot reload** provided instant feedback
- **TypeScript** caught errors before runtime
- **Tailwind CSS** enabled rapid styling iteration
- **shadcn/ui** provided production-ready components

### Iterative Enhancement
Each feature built naturally upon the previous:
1. **Basic card display** → **Interactive animations**
2. **Static content** → **Dynamic API integration**
3. **Simple layouts** → **Advanced responsive design**
4. **Basic styling** → **Sophisticated design system**

## 🚀 Recreation Prompt

If I were to rebuild this entire application from scratch, here's the single prompt that would recreate it:

```
Create a "Character Universe" discovery app with these specifications:

CORE FEATURES:
- Interactive character cards that flip to reveal chat interfaces
- Horizontal scrolling character gallery with navigation arrows
- Real-time chat system with AI character responses
- Progress tracking for character interactions
- Sharing functionality for character conversations

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimalist, typography-focused design with ultra-light fonts
- 3D card flip animations with mouse tilt effects
- Ambient lighting with gradient overlays and blur effects
- Clean loading states and error handling
- Fully responsive design with mobile-first approach

TECHNICAL STACK:
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- shadcn/ui component library
- TanStack Query for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Supabase backend integration

API INTEGRATION:
- Connect to: https://yevyfxmmijukjohbdjwv.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-public-cards
- Character data: { id, name, goal, image_url, intro_message }
- Chat endpoint: POST to /functions/v1/chat with { character_id, message }
- Implement proper loading states and error handling

UI COMPONENTS:
- CharacterCard: Flip animation, chat interface, progress bar, share button
- CharacterCarousel: Horizontal scroll, navigation arrows, responsive grid
- Clean header with "Character Universe" branding
- Subtle animations using CSS keyframes and Tailwind classes

DESIGN SYSTEM:
- HSL-based semantic color tokens in index.css
- Custom Tailwind utilities for 3D effects and animations
- Consistent spacing and typography scale
- Dark/light mode support via CSS variables

Follow modern React patterns, ensure type safety, and create a polished user experience.
```

This single prompt would recreate the entire application because it includes:
- **Clear feature specifications** 
- **Detailed design requirements**
- **Specific technical choices**
- **API endpoint information**
- **Component structure guidance**
- **Design system principles**

The key to success was having a well-defined API specification and design philosophy from the beginning.

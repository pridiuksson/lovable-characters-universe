# Product Backlog: `vite_react_shadcn_ts`

This document outlines potential improvements and new features for the `vite_react_shadcn_ts` application. The goal is to enhance robustness, code cleanliness, maintainability, and user experience.

## I. Code Quality & Robustness

1.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Description:** Introduce unit and integration tests for components, hooks, and utility functions.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve code reliability, prevent regressions, and facilitate safer refactoring.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/lib/`, `src/pages/`.
    *   **Tools:** Vitest, React Testing Library.
    *   **Priority:** High
    *   **Status:** In Progress (Basic setup and initial tests added)

2.  **Stricter TypeScript Configuration:**
    *   **Description:** Enable stricter type checking options in `tsconfig.json` (e.g., `noImplicitAny: true`, `strictNullChecks: true`, `noUnusedLocals: true`, `noUnusedParameters: true`).
    *   **Rationale:** Catch potential errors at compile-time, improve code quality, and enhance developer experience.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Entire codebase.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

3.  **Refactor `CharacterCard.tsx` for Modularity:**
    *   **Description:** The `CharacterCard.tsx` component is quite large and handles multiple concerns (display, animation, chat interface). Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused sub-components (e.g., `CardFront`, `CardChatView`, `ChatInput`).
    *   **Rationale:** Improve readability, maintainability, and testability of the component.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `src/components/CharacterCard.tsx`.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

4.  **Centralized API Service Layer:**
    *   **Description:** If API calls are scattered, create a dedicated service layer (e.g., `src/services/api.ts`) to encapsulate API call logic. This layer would be used by `react-query` hooks.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve organization, reduce redundancy, and make API interactions easier to manage and mock for tests.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Anywhere API calls are made, likely within `react-query` hooks or page components.
    *   **Priority:** Medium (depends on current API call structure)

5.  **Error Handling and Boundary Components:**
    *   **Description:** Implement more robust error handling for API requests within `react-query` hooks. Introduce React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle rendering errors in parts of the UI.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve application stability and user experience when errors occur.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Data fetching logic, component rendering.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

6.  **Accessibility (a11y) Audit and Improvements:**
    *   **Description:** Perform an accessibility audit of the application, particularly interactive components like `CharacterCard` and forms. Ensure proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
    *   **Rationale:** Make the application usable for a wider range of users, including those with disabilities.
    *   **Affected Areas:** All UI components.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

## II. Feature Enhancements

1.  **Real-time Chat Functionality:**
    *   **Description:** Replace the mock chat interaction in `CharacterCard.tsx` with a real-time chat backend (e.g., using WebSockets, Firebase, or a similar service).
    *   **Rationale:** Provide a dynamic and engaging user experience.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `src/components/CharacterCard.tsx`, potentially new backend services.
    *   **Priority:** High (if core to product vision)

2.  **User Authentication:**
    *   **Description:** Implement user accounts to allow users to save their progress, preferences, or created content.
    *   **Rationale:** Personalize user experience and enable more features.
    *   **Affected Areas:** New auth pages, components, and potentially backend integration.
    *   **Priority:** High (if user-specific data is planned)

3.  **Character Customization/Creation:**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to create or customize their own characters.
    *   **Rationale:** Increase user engagement and content variety.
    *   **Affected Areas:** New forms, UI for character editing, backend storage.
    *   **Priority:** Medium-High

4.  **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   **Description:** Add support for multiple languages.
    *   **Rationale:** Expand the application's reach to a global audience.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Text content throughout the application, new localization framework (e.g., `i18next`).
    *   **Priority:** Medium

5.  **Advanced Search and Filtering for Characters:**
    *   **Description:** If the number of characters grows, implement more advanced search and filtering options on the main page or carousel.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve discoverability of characters.
    *   **Affected Areas:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`, `src/components/CharacterCarousel.tsx`.
    *   **Priority:** Low-Medium

## III. Developer Experience & Tooling

1.  **Storybook Integration:**
    *   **Description:** Set up Storybook for component development and visualization.
    *   **Rationale:** Facilitate isolated component development, testing, and documentation.
    *   **Affected Areas:** New Storybook configuration and stories for components.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

2.  **Automated CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **Description:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate linting, testing, and deployment.
    *   **Rationale:** Streamline the development workflow and ensure code quality.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Repository configuration.
    *   **Priority:** Medium

3.  **Bundle Size Analysis and Optimization:**
    *   **Description:** Regularly analyze the production bundle size and implement optimization techniques (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading components/routes beyond the current setup).
    *   **Rationale:** Improve application load times and performance.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Vite configuration, component imports.
    *   **Priority:** Low-Medium

## IV. UI/UX Refinements

1.  **Enhanced Loading States:**
    *   **Description:** Implement more sophisticated loading skeletons or indicators for data fetching operations, especially for images within `CharacterCard`.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve perceived performance and user experience during loading.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Components that fetch data, `CharacterCard.tsx`.
    *   **Priority:** Low

2.  **Theme Customization (Dark/Light Mode persistence):**
    *   **Description:** Ensure theme preferences (e.g., dark/light mode, if `next-themes` is fully utilized) are persisted across sessions (e.g., using `localStorage`).
    *   **Rationale:** Improve user experience by remembering preferences.
    *   **Affected Areas:** Theme switching logic, potentially `src/App.tsx` or a theme provider.
    *   **Priority:** Low

This backlog is a living document and should be regularly reviewed and updated based on project priorities and evolving requirements.
